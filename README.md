# react-spaceship-canvas

A playground for toying around with react, HTML canvas and rendering. In this sample a small spaceship is following the 
cursor around the screen.

The goal of the project was to familiarize myself with how to use the HTML Canvas in react web apps and learn more 
about drawing on the canvas.
